1. Declare your age as integer variable
2. Declare your height as a float variable
3. Declare a variable that store a complex number
4. Write a script that prompts the user to enter base and height of the triangle and calculate an area of this triangle (area = 0.5 x b x h).
 4.1 Enter base: 20
    Enter height: 10
    The area of the triangle is 100
5. Write a script that prompts the user to enter side a, side b, and side c of the triangle. Calculate the perimeter of the triangle (perimeter = a + b + c).
6. Get length and width of a rectangle using prompt. Calculate its area (area = length x width) and perimeter (perimeter = 2 x (length + width))
7. Get radius of a circle using prompt. Calculate the area (area = pi x r x r) and circumference (c = 2 x pi x r) where pi = 3.14.
8. Calculate the slope, x-intercept and y-intercept of y = 2x -2
9. Slope is (m = y2-y1/x2-x1). Find the slope and between point (2, 2) and point (6,10)
